#### Architecture

---
This is what is known as a 'folly' - a structure that does not have a particular practical purpose - something between a sculpture and a building. The large fish was designed to glimmer and twinkle, like a fish moving underwater. The building works well from far away - it can be seen from all of the way down the beach. Once you arrive however you discover the golden fish is hollow - a shock for some true architect lovers.

Frank Gehry also designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and The Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. And for those who love their celebrity gossip, he is a close friend of Brad Pitt.
